# Winter 22 C++ Refresher

This directory will be dedicated to refreshing my C++ skills for potential interview challenges in the near future. I will primarily be basing this review on the book `C++ Crash Course` by `Josh Lospinoso`.

## Why C++?

> I am interested in systems programming and am looking to explore the potential applications of C++ in optimizing and developing tools in the web application infrastructure and network engineering/web security spaces. Recently, I completed my Operating Systems course and am enrolled in Web Security and Computer Communications courses, in which I intend to apply my knowledge of C++. The best way I believe to succeed in these endeavors is to solidify and enhance my competence in the C++ programming language.

## Alternatives?

> I will learn Rust later... Well, the truth is that I have tried Rust and have actually taken a liking to it. However, I still believe that the majority of my coursework will continue to be in C++, and thus at this time it is still a higher priority- although that will not bar me from exploring it at a slightly slower pace. Another backend language I look forward to exploring is Go.

### In Short...

Get ready to see some C++ programs and what I hope is some great documentation!
